Introduction

The main objective of this project is to check the health of a person smartly. In this project we are measuring some different things of room like temperature, humidity, air quality, water TDS and LPG leakage. These all things will help to check the room environment. These all things we measure with the help of arudino sensors. Arduino is an IOT device. Here we connected different sensors with Arduino. Arduino sends the data to firebase with the help of internet. We get data in form of integer. The Arduino sends Realtime database to firebase. And firebase sends data to our android application. We made an android application which helps to control all the sensors and check the current status of our room or home. If any problem will create then the sensor will send the data to our app then app will analyse the data and alert us. This is a very good thing for checking our Health.

Motivation

Android and IOT both are very important for today. In day to day life we are seeing many of IOT devices that are very useful. Smart Bulb, Smart Assistant, Smart Watch, Smart Alarm, Smart Home, Smart TV etc. These all are example of IOT. These all things are making human life easier. It saves time and hard work.

DATA MANAGEMENT

The Arduino Device measure the raw data and sends in integer format.
The Firebase collect all these data.
We can increase or decrease of refresh time of live data.
Android application Show the real time data and analyse it; whether our room environment is safe or not.

LANGUAGE, TOOLS AND SERVICES

Adobe XD (for UI Designing)
Python
Arduino Sensors
Firebase
Weather API





STEPS OF WORKING OUR PROJECT

Step 1: Arduino sensors measure the data and collect it.
Step 2: Arduino sends the data to Firebase.
Step 3: Firebase collect all the real time data and storeit  in real-time database.
Step 4: Firebase sends data to Android application.
Step 5: Android application Show the Live Data.
Step 6: Android application calculate the Data and give the alert information according the real time data.


FUTURE WORK
I really wanted to learn more about the android application and IOT devices and how it can be implemented in the field of mechanical.
